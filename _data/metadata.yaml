title: "Desecrting the Sacred"
description: "Desecrating the Sacred is the result of a decades-long meditation that raises a profound question with planetary implications: What happens when the Sacred Free Existence of the Original Native Nations and Peoples of Turtle Island (&ldquo;North America&rdquo;) which honors All of Creation is invaded and thereby desecrated by an invading People who have traversed a vast ocean, an invading People who claim they are carrying a Sacred Right of Domination given to them by their &ldquo;God&rdquo;?"
